# Forgotten-Skyscraper
An action platformer developed using Godot Engine for my CS degree. I did the game design, level design, implementation, art and sound effects.

# Design, Motivation, etc
My Bachelor's final project goes deeper into the design process, project motivations, tools used and general description of the development. Read it at:

OBS: The project is written in Portuguese. Some information might not match the current build of the game, as it has been developed further since the project's delivery date.
